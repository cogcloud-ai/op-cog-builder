"""Op spec: load, validate, refuse by name, and evaluate mapping expressions.

Machinery master (cog-smith `templates/op/src/`). An Op package never edits
this file — `smith op check` enforces it by hash, exactly as `smith check`
enforces Cog machinery. If an Op needs behaviour this module does not have,
the answer is a Cog step, never a script in the Op.

The spec is `openteams/op-manifest [0.1]`: identity, declared `inputs`, a
list of Cog `steps` with mapping expressions for their requests, optional
`outputs`, and the `track` records. The vocabulary is CLOSED — anything the
runner subset does not carry is refused BY NAME at load, with the phase that
adds it, so an author never discovers a missing construct mid-run.
